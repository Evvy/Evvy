# Welcome <sup>:tm:</sup>

Hi there! You can just call me **Evvy**. I'm an avid coder and a philomath - I simply love learning new things.\
My journey started ages ago as I was traversing through some **`HTML`** code to setup my first website.\
Soon thereafter I caught the eye of **`CSS`**, and got around to dropping some sparkles on my otherwise sad markup.\
Things escalated quickly over the years and I eventually picked up multiple interesting languages, such as: **`PHP`**, **`JavaScript`**, **`SQL`**, **`Lua`**, **`Python`**, **`Java`**, and a hint of **`C#`**.\
Looking forward I hope to dip my toes into some **`Ruby`** programming along with some scripting.
